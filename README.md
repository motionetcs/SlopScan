# SlopScan

SlopScan is a privacy-conscious review trust analyzer for online shopping. Shoppers paste a product URL, paste or import reviews, and get an explainable dashboard that shows the review patterns behind the rating.

## Separate Product Description

SlopScan helps online shoppers decide whether product reviews are useful, repetitive, promotional, mismatched, or grounded in real buyer experience. It does not claim to prove that a review is fake. Instead, it turns pasted marketplace reviews into a clear trust report with review-risk scoring, repeated phrase clusters, buyer issue extraction, seller-claim support checks, and a copyable summary for quick decisions.

Short pitch:

## Deployment

This repo includes a GitHub Pages workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and a Vercel config at `vercel.json`.

On every push to `main`, GitHub Actions:

1. Installs dependencies with `npm ci`.
2. Runs TypeScript checks.
3. Builds the Vite app.
4. Deploys `dist/` to GitHub Pages.

Vercel uses the same production build:

```text
npm run build
dist/
```

Live Vercel app:

https://slopscan-tau.vercel.app/
```

## Note

SlopScan flags suspicious review patterns. It does not prove that a review is fake and does not replace human judgment.
