# SlopScan

SlopScan is a review trust analyzer for online shopping. It helps shoppers inspect the quality of product reviews before trusting a rating.

## Real Product Name

Canonical GitHub repository:

## Core Flow

## Local Development

npm install
npm run dev
```

## Validation

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run analyze:demo
```

## Deployment

This repo includes a GitHub Pages workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and a Vercel config at `vercel.json`.

On every push to `main`, GitHub Actions:

1. Installs dependencies with `npm ci`.
2. Runs TypeScript checks.
3. Builds the Vite app.
4. Deploys `dist/` to GitHub Pages.

Vercel uses the same production build:

```text
npm run build
dist/
```

## Note

SlopScan flags suspicious review patterns. It does not prove that a review is fake and does not replace human judgment.
